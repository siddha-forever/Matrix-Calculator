# Matrix Calculator

Matrix Calculator is a console-based application written in C that performs various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, matrix multiplication, transpose, determinant, adjoint, and inverse. The program supports matrices of up to 100x100 dimensions.

## Features

1. **Matrix Addition**: Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.
2. **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtracts one matrix from another of the same dimensions.
3. **Scalar Multiplication**: Multiplies a matrix by a scalar value.
4. **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiplies two matrices if they are compatible for multiplication.
5. **Matrix Transpose**: Calculates the transpose of a matrix.
6. **Matrix Determinant**: Calculates the determinant of a matrix.
7. **Adjoint Matrix**: Calculates the adjoint of a matrix.
8. **Inverse Matrix**: Calculates the inverse of a matrix if it exists.
